Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that 
will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this 
first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your 
findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on 
how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where 
necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences 
and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be 
required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, 
you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting 
and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions 
you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where
indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able 
to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) 
to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout
application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact
for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
		SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM table
	
	i. 		Attribute table = 10000
	ii. 	Business table = 10000
	iii. 	Category table = 10000
	iv. 	Checkin table = 10000
	v. 		elite_years table = 10000 
	vi. 	friend table = 10000
	vii. 	hours table = 10000
	viii. 	photo table = 10000
	ix. 	review table = 10000
	x. 		tip table = 10000
	xi. 	user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total number of distinct records for each of the keys listed below:

		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
		FROM table

	i. 		Business = id: 10000
	ii. 	Hours = business_id: 1562
	iii. 	Category = business_id: 2643
	iv. 	Attribute = business_id: 1115
	v. 		Review = id:10000, business_id: 8090, user_id: 9581
	vi. 	Checkin = business_id: 493
	vii. 	Photo = id: 10000, business_id: 6493
	viii. 	Tip = user_id: 537, business_id: 3979
	ix. 	User = id: 10000
	x. 		Friend = user_id: 11
	xi. 	Elite_years = user_id: 2780
	


3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: "no"
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
		SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM user
		WHERE id IS NULL OR 
		  name IS NULL OR 
		  review_count IS NULL OR 
		  yelping_since IS NULL OR
		  useful IS NULL OR 
		  funny IS NULL OR 
		  cool IS NULL OR 
		  fans IS NULL OR 
		  average_stars IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_hot IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_more IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_profile IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_cute IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_list IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_note IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_plain IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_cool IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_funny IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_writer IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_photos IS NULL 
	

	
4. Find the minimum, maximum, and average value for the following fields:

		SELECT AVG(column)
		FROM table

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1 		max: 5		avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min: 0		max: 2000		avg: 24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
		SELECT city,
			   SUM(review_count) AS reviews
		FROM business
		GROUP BY city
		ORDER BY reviews DESC
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	
		+-----------------+---------+
		| city            | reviews |
		+-----------------+---------+

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. 	Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city
	or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to 
	the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	As Toronto attracts tourists across globe, I chose category Restaurant for comparision of stars.
	I added day_of_week parameter and converted it to category [monday = 1, tuesday =2 ...] to see if
	effect of weekends is present. BUt, It is not observed. 

	i.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	
			In general, The 2-3 star group had longer hours than 4-5 star group.
			
			| name          | review_count | hours                 | postal_code | day_of_week | star_rating |

			| 99 Cent Sushi |            5 | Monday|11:00-23:00    | M5B 2E5     |           1 | 2-3 stars   |
			| Pizzaiolo     |           34 | Monday|9:00-23:00     | M5H 1X6     |           1 | 2-3 stars   |
			| Edulis        |           89 | Wednesday|18:00-23:00 | M5V         |           3 | 4-5 stars   |
			| Sushi Osaka   |            8 | Monday|11:00-23:00    | M9A 1C2     |           1 | 4-5 stars   |
	
	ii.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	
		Sushi Osaka is 4-5 star group but has only 8 reviews. Whereas Edulis had amassed 89 reviews. No definite
		correaltion is noticed.  
	
	iii.	Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two
		groups? Explain.

		NO, only 4 restaurants are located on yelp and all are in different zip codes. Ignoring small sample size; 
		Naively, one can say that restaurant in M5 have higher chance of getting more reviews. 

	SQL code used for analysis:
	
	SELECT B.name,
		B.review_count,
		H.hours,
		postal_code,
		CASE
			WHEN hours LIKE "monday%" THEN 1
			WHEN hours LIKE "tuesday%" THEN 2
			WHEN hours LIKE "wednesday%" THEN 3
			WHEN hours LIKE "thursday%" THEN 4
			WHEN hours LIKE "friday%" THEN 5
			WHEN hours LIKE "saturday%" THEN 6
			WHEN hours LIKE "sunday%" THEN 7
		END AS day_of_week,			   
		CASE
			WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
			WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
		END AS star_rating
	FROM business B INNER JOIN hours H
	ON B.id = H.business_id
	INNER JOIN category C
	ON C.business_id = B.id
	WHERE (B.city == 'Toronto'
	AND
	C.category LIKE 'Restaurants')
	AND
	(B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3
	OR
	B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
	GROUP BY stars, day_of_week
	ORDER BY day_of_week, star_rating ASC

		
		
2.	Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What
	differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are
	closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your
	answer.
		
	i. 	Difference 1:
	
		Open businesses have more reviews than closed businesses - on average.
		
			Open:   AVG(review_count) = 31.757
			Closed: AVG(review_count) = 23.198
	
	
	ii.	Difference 2:
	
		Open businesses have more stars than closed businesses - on average.
	
			Open:   AVG(stars) = 3.679
			Closed: AVG(stars) = 3.520
	
	SQL code used for analysis:
	
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)),
				SUM(review_count)
			   AVG(review_count),,
			   AVG(stars),
			   is_open
		FROM business
		GROUP BY is_open
	
	
3. 	For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you
	want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
	
	Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment 
	analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, 
	predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a 
	user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel 
	free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide
	answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
	i. 	Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
	
		Predicting whether a business will flourish or not.   
	
	ii.	Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis
		and why you chose that data:
		
		Business would flourish if it has more good reviews, star rating of business, location.
		Attributes are used to denote environment at businesses.
		
	iii.	Output of your finished dataset:
